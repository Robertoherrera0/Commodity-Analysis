# Commodity Data Analysis Tool

## Description
This web application provides an interactive platform to analyze and predict commodity market trends. It leverages Python for data fetching and R for data visualization, offering users an in-depth look at commodities market data.

## Features
- Allows users to select a commodity for analysis.
- Displays visual representation of the commodity's market performance.
- Offers predictive trends based on recent market data.

## Technologies
- Python for backend operations and data fetching.
- R for generating interactive time-series plots.
- Flask as the web framework.
- Docker for containerization and easy deployment.

## How It Works
The application consists of two main parts:
1. **Data Fetching**: Implemented in Python, this part fetches commodity data based on user input using a RESTful API.
2. **Data Visualization**: Using R, the application processes the data, analyze it and creates an interactive plot.

When a user selects a commodity, the Python script fetches the data and the R script generates a plot which is then displayed on the web page.

## Docker and Deployment
The application is containerized using Docker, which ensures that it can be easily deployed on any system without worrying about dependencies.

### Dockerfile
The Dockerfile contains all the necessary instructions to build the application's Docker image. It sets up the environment, installs Python and R dependencies, and specifies how the application should be run.

### Running the Application
To run the application:
1. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t commodity-analysis .`
2. Run the Docker container: `docker run -p 5000:5000 commodity-analysis`

The application will be accessible on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Hosting on Google Cloud
This application is ready to be hosted on Google Cloud. By using services like Google Cloud Run or Kubernetes Engine, the Docker container can be deployed to the cloud, making the application accessible online.
